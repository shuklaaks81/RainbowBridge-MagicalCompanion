# Special Kids Assistant Project Instructions

This is a specialized AI application designed to help autistic children with limited communication skills. The application focuses on:

## Core Principles
- **Sensory-Friendly Design**: Use calm colors, minimal animations, and clear visual hierarchy
- **Predictable Interactions**: Maintain consistent UI patterns and responses
- **Visual Communication**: Prioritize images, symbols, and visual cues over text
- **Routine Support**: Help establish and maintain daily routines and schedules
- **Personalized Learning**: Adapt to individual communication styles and learning pace

## Technical Guidelines
- Use simple, clear language in all communications
- Implement visual feedback for all interactions
- Ensure accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Provide multiple communication modalities (text, images, audio)
- Include progress tracking and caregiver insights
- Implement timeout handling for longer interactions
- Use positive reinforcement patterns

## AI Model Considerations
- Configure for patient, encouraging responses
- Use simple sentence structures
- Avoid overwhelming information
- Implement emotional intelligence in responses
- Support non-verbal communication cues
- Provide consistent personality and behavior
